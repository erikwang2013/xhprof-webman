/**
 * Prepare a value for transfer across the V8 isolate boundary.
 *
 * isolated-vm's `copy: true` uses structured clone, which strips prototypes
 * from non-standard types. Luxon DateTime/Duration/Interval lose their class
 * identity and arrive on the host as plain objects.
 *
 * This function recursively walks a value and converts types that don't
 * survive structured clone into their string representations. It runs
 * inside the isolate before the result is transferred.
 *
 * Note: JS Date objects survive structured clone with prototype intact
 * (Date is a standard structured-cloneable type) and are not converted.
 *
 * Circular references are not handled — expression results should not
 * contain cycles.
